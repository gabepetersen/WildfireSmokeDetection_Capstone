# WildfireSmokeDetection_Capstone
A capstone project for team 24 to develop a wildfire smoke detection algorithm that incorporates time-based learning and smoke density recognition.

# The Team
Zachary Black

Gabe Petersen

William Williams

# To Do List

- Revise image preprocessing code to get rid of blurry, camera shake, and unneccessary frames via optical flow

- Modify database to operate on a cloud based service like AWS

- Preprocess videos and put on database

- Design program to, frame-by-frame, identify and label regions containing smoke based on computer vision techniques (optical flow, image segmentation, etc...)

- Design program to verify with user if the previous program identified the regions correctly (no false positives or negatives for each region)

- After data is totally preprocessed and given correct labels, put into database under seperate table

- Divide into convolutions (possibly on regions, filtered frames, etc...)

- train network
